 * quieter than the one accent and the destructive state.
 *
 * The fills are colour-mixed over `--card`, not bare `/10` tints: the badge sits
 * on the card's OG backdrop where the scrim is thinnest, and a translucent fill
 * smudges the letter into the texture. Mixing over `--card` keeps the same tint
 * while staying opaque in both themes.
